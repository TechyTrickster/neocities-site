this is a clone of flappy bird that I made with some guidance from "Game Development with Pico-8" by Dylan Bennet in a single day. It was largely an exercise in programming practice.

I tried to pay attention to the token count of my code (an important aspect of pico-8 programs), though, I failed in that respect when it came to the collision code.
