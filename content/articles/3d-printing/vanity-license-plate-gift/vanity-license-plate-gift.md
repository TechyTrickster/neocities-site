### Gift for my Step Dad

---

Getting gifts for my Step Dad is hard, for everyone in my family.  For Christmas and his birthday, every year we all struggle.  The problem is really 2 fold.  

1. He's an adult with some amount of disposable income: capable of buying things he wants on his own
2. There's not a whole lot he's interested in getting

This year, thankfully, my Mom came up with a pretty good idea.  *Make* him a custom vanity license plate.  We brainstormed a bit on what to add to it, and after about a half hour, we came up with a design!  For the longest time, his nickname around the family has been 'Mr. P', and he's been a life long Chicago Bears fan.  So, I incorporated both.  I made the text using onshape's text tool, and I traced a good quality image of the Bears logo using the spline tool.

The print had to be split up into 4 parts, half due to my 3d printer's limited (~200mm x ~200mm) print bed, and half due to wanting a 2 tone design. Assembled (though not completely glued together), the print looks like this:

I used [this site](https://www.lookupaplate.com/blog/license-plate-sizes/) to get the standardized US plate dimensions.  The plate itself is held together with superglue and 6 m3 18mm long steel dowels.

The final product came out very sturdy.  Certainly more so than typical plastic vanity plates are.  I do have some concerns about the longevity of the gift on 2 fronts:

1. UV light - color
	1. issue: UV light (like from the sun) tends to wash out the colors of plastics, and PLA is no different
	2. solution: I may start looking into UV resistant clear coats
2. UV light - brittleness
	1. issue: UV light tends to make plastics of many kinds more brittle and prone to cracking over time.
	2. solution: same as previous
3. impacts
	1. issue: roads aren't very clean.  I suspect that eventually, this thing is going to take a beating from small to medium sized pebbles and rocks kicked up by cars in front of his, like on the express way.
	2. solution: higher infill or or more durable print materials

I'm hoping that it will at least last 6 months, but only time will tell!  I'm also hoping that he appreciates it, too!
