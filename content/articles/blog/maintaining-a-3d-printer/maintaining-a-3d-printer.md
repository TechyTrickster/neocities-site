### maintaining a 3d printer

---

When I first got into 3D printing, I'm not exactly sure how much work I thought keeping my printer running would involve, but it definitely wasn't this much.  I've taken the extrusion head of my [Anycubic Kobra 2](https://store.anycubic.com/products/kobra-2) apart a few times now, for various reasons.  Today, I took it apart because my printer started throwing the error: "Hotend Heater Abnormal", and the prints stop within minutes of starting, as well as having *awful* under-extrusion issues.  So, I followed this [maintenance guide](https://wiki.anycubic.com/en/fdm-3d-printer/kobra-2/hotend-heater-abnormal) After following the two different paths in the guide (reseating the connectors in the base and extrusion head, and checking the resistance of the heater), I determined that the issue was a broken hotend.  This is the second time since last July (when I bought my printer) that I've had to replace the [hotend](https://www.amazon.com/ANYCUBIC-Printing-Anycubic-Kobra-Printer/dp/B0C65VHDN1?crid=218NTXCC20DSW&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.XWAeuBWtWY9fsFNjaqam9V7TXPCQ7j4nihWbWwhuhQQgU5BctpFtyncHqaXQUSWtArFGoCGTqunEUznBVGui4Lywjoi-Ur3TNghdu_6ah-FuKKVrVaRKwPA4MARQ0q9rD_znCBtpcByPEJfHTerV2_UWnxtLYuzLChXdRIg-3OMk0rMwwY18yt4yoR9Thdi0nII5XFpe9Rxc8XTeDZKTSaaBuItFYdUW4WFsmd2_X2c.CS9mWXGoRboNI_GeFGmRk8UhB5BvrX4zrDsEdwZ5jgo&dib_tag=se&keywords=hotend+anycubic+kobra+2&qid=1745894020&sprefix=hotend+anycubic+kobra+2%2Caps%2C96&sr=8-1).  The first time was due to a feeder failure that caused a massive accumulation of melted PLA around the nozzle.

My main issue is that I don't know what caused the heater to fail.  Its resistance should show as 10 to 15 ohms, but instead, now it reads as around 3M ohms.  I do know that it was an off brand replacement part I installed in mid February, so it may have been a poor quality part?
