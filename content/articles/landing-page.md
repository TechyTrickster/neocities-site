### Welcome to Andrew's Site!

---
Greetings and salutations!  This site is my portofolio, cataloging and showcasing all of my various projects, creations, and works.  Its also a demonstartion of my web development skills!  I have projects going all the way back to my undergrad days hosted here.  

The site I've built here reflects my design philosophy, which is that applications should be *minimal* in terms of memory footprint and processing needs.  For instance, a site made up mostly of static text and images **should not** cripple a mid to high end workstation like many other sites do.  To that end, this site should have fairly minimal requirements, and should be able to be loaded on quite modest (and old) machines.  

I've worked on everything from creative writing, to 3D printing, to coding, and even art!  I hope what you find here will tell you about my own capabilities as well as inspire you to work on (or more likely *keep* working on) your own projects!
