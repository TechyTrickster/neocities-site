### Drawing Compass
----

In my pursuit to improve my product design and modeling skills, I started creating a 3D printed drawing compass.  It prints in 8 pieces;

1. left arm
2. right arm
3. locking wheel (x4)
4. guide
5. pencil holder

Its the first project on which i used heat set inserts.  There are a few things that I've learned about using them.  

1. my soldering iron tip is too long and will poke past the bottom of a small m3 insert
2. sizing of the mounting holes is nowhere near as sensitive as I though and you really can just eyeball it
3. freehanding the inserts is straightforward and easy, but also easy to mess up the surface angle.

the product itself has turned out rather nicely.  Three knobs to adjust and lock in a position, and a single knob to lock in the pencil (ie, a normal drawing compass!)  It feels nice enough in the hand, too!  Overall, it costs about 1 USD worth of materials to make this product at the current prices i'm buying materials at.


Amazingly, this design only took 2 iterations to get to the picture above, and about 10 hours of design work, which, for its complexity, is a good jump in speed from my previous efforts!
