### Can Crusher

---

Need a tool, make a tool.  Recently, I started drinking diet soda, again.  Its not necessarily great for your health, but here I am...  (still better than regular, by a lot!)  This has created quite a few cans, which take up a lot of space!  I figured, instead of going to the hardware store or Amazon and picking one up, I'd design and make one myself!  So, I looked around on the net and found a design that I liked and adapted it for 3d printing!  I based it on this model that I found on Amazon ([here](https://www.amazon.com/Crushers-Smasher-Aluminum-Recycling-Compactor/dp/B0B978F3LR?th=1))

This is by far the largest model that I've ever finished, as well as the most complicated in terms of assembly and function.  It has 3 moving parts.
