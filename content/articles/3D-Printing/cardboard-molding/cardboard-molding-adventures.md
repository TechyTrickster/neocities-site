Years ago, before I got into 3D printing and product design, I saw a video on creating cardboard products with 3D printed molds.  I attribute a lot of my initial interest in 3D printing to this video (youtube video referenced below! [^1])  The concept is simple; make a 2 (or more) part mold, stuff it full of cardboard pulp, and wait a few days.  At the end of it, you have a fairly sturdy cardboard part!  Made from materials that are so cheap as to be almost free.  

Almost immediately after getting my first 3D printer, i started trying to create multi-part molds to make cardboard parts.  the first product is actually still on my desk, as, amazingly, it didn't fall apart when i took it out!
