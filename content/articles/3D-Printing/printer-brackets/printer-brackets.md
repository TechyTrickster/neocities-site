3D printers are big, heavy, and **loud**.  Previously, my 3D printer was living, and *running* next to my gaming PC.  being the very social person I am, I'm on discord every night with friends.  Unfortunately, all the different mics that I have all pick up my 3d printer quite loudly while its running.  This has forced me to spend many a night living on push to talk.  This was very annoying!  So, to solve it, I cleared out some space in my hallway closet, on top of a cubby organizer.  This has kept all of the noise away from my setups, so no more push to talk!.  However, this has introduced a new problem.  While its printing, the machine shakes a good bit, and on top of the cubby organzier, it moves a lot, and quickly will move forward and the front feet will fall off!  To solve this, I modeled some custom j-brackets!

Amazingly, against all odds, I got the dimensions and design right the first try!!!
