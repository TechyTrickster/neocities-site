Adhesive wall hooks have been a widely available product for a while.  Anyone can go to their local big box store and pick up a few dozen 1/2 lb capacity hooks for $20.  However, they pretty much only come in transparent and solid white.  This is OK if you only need a few hooks or if they'll all be hidden by something, but this is often not the case.  Even though most folk have white walls, the white of the hooks simply doesn't match the white of the walls.  Enter my color matched wall hook service.  The process is simply, take a picture of your walls under strong, direct sunlight, and send me the picture.  I'll then color match a spool of PLA 3D printing filament to that, and print you a batch of wall hooks that will seamlessly blend into your living space, without drawing any attention to itself.

here is an example of the prototype wall hook.  as you can see, it is capable of being mounted to a wall with a nail, as well as the common, removable adheasive strips.

here is an example of a widely commericially available wall hook.  They're relatively cheap, easy to use, but sadly, they stick out when placed in the open on nearly any wall.
