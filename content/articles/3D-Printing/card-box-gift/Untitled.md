### A Card Box For a Friend

---

A few months ago, a friend of mine started really getting into the new One Piece TCG.  Fast forward to now, they're even more into.  So, they asked me to create a custom card box for them after the off the shelf model I printed for them turned out to be a bit to *delicate*.   After running some questions by them, I settled on using these two images to create embellishments on the top and front of the box.
