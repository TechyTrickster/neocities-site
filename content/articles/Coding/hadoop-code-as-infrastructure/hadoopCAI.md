# Hadoop Cluster Maker
---

This is a program that I wrote in undergrad for a distributed computing course.  I wouldn't know what Infrastructure as Code was for another couple of years, but I certainly stumbled into the pattern on my own to solve the incredibly frustrating and time consuming problem of repeatedly redeploying the installer for a physical hadoop cluster across half a dozen nodes over and over and over again.
