### About Me

---

![Andrew Phifer](/assets/images/AndrewPhiferHeadshot.jpg)

My name is Andrew Phifer.  Born and raised as a Ranch Dressing loving Midwesterner in the suburbs of Chicago, IL. I'm many things.  By formal education, I'm a computer scientist.  By experience, I'm quite a few other things.  To name a few:

* Business Analyst
* Quality Assurance Engineer
* Debate Judge
* Debate Coach
* Product Designer

I've always enjoyed trying new things, learning new things, and being a *maker* in general.  Much to the detriment of my free time, I've accumulated even more hobbies.  To name **quite** a few:

* Video Games
* Media Archiving
* Reading (fiction and non-fiction)
* Music
* Smart Home Automation
* Server Home Labing 
* Web Comics
* TV Shows (especially Mythbusters)
* Hanging Out With Friends
* Table Top RPGS (like Dungeons & Dragons)
* 3D Printing / Model Making
* Writing
* Science!

Honestly, I'm always wishing for more time in a day!  As a result of all of this, I'm quite well rounded in knowledge and experience, capable of quickly adapting to any challenge that comes my way, and any task that I set my sights on!
