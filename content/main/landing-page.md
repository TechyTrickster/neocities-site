### Welcome to Andrew's Site!

---
Greetings and salutations!  This site is my portfolio, cataloging and showcasing all of my various projects, creations, and works.  Its also a demonstration of my web development skills!  I have projects going all the way back to my undergrad days hosted here.  

The site I've built here reflects my design philosophy, which is that applications should be *minimal* in terms of memory footprint and processing needs.  To that end, this site should have fairly minimal requirements, and should be able to be loaded on quite modest (and old) machines.  This is also the first website that I've ever built and had hosted, which has been quite the valuable learning experience for me!  I've coded this site more or less from scratch, with the hopes of learning much more that way, rather than using templates or static site generators.  I *have* noticed that my site backend is resembling a static site generator more and more as time goes on.  The general concept I'm following is to create site content as markdown pages using Obsidian directly on neocities using a mounted WebDAV drive, and some javascript on the frontend convert the hosted md into html which it embeds in the web pages.

I've worked on everything from creative writing, to 3D printing, to coding, and even art!  Over time, I'll prepare and showcase my projects here.  I hope what you find here will tell you about my own capabilities as well as inspire you to work on (or more likely *keep* working on) your own projects!
