### [Writing](/pages/topic_directory?category=writing)

---

I got into creative writing in high school.  I'd write poetry every week and post it to a Wordpress site that I maintained.  I stopped while I was in college, and only picked it back up recently, though, even then, I haven't devoted as much time as I'd like to it.  Hopefully, this section will become filled with completed and in progress works over the next few months.
