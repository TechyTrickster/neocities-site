I've always been into games of one stripe or another.  One of my earliest memories is going to a pawn shop with my father and buying a green Nintendo Game Boy Color (which I not only still have, but it also still works!)  For the last 8 years, almost every night I get online with half a dozen friends and play games for a few hours and talk about anything and everything.  I started thinking about making my own games in high school, when I made a *very* simple vertical shmup in Processing (a Java framework) as a final project for a programming class.  Since then, I've dabbled in making my own games.  More often than not, its in the form of running my own D&D campaigns with friends.  These days, I more interested in creating video games, though...
