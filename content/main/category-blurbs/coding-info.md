As a software engineer, this is by far my largest category of work.  I've worked on a wide variety of challenges, from distributed to computing, to large scale text analysis, to small and useful terminal utilities.

I first got interested in programming back in middle school, and as soon as I got the opportunity to start picking my own classes, which happened freshman year of high school, I started taking coding classes.  By the end of my high school career, I had taken every single coding class the school offered (QBasic, Visual Basic, C++, AP Computer Science).  I've never stopped since.  It showed me just how much I love working with computers, and solving problems!
