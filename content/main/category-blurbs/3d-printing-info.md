I bought my first 3D Printer in July of 2024.  Though, I've been captivated by the concept since I first heard about it back in late high school.  (for context, I graduated in 2014)  Once I assembled my printer (an Anycubic Kobra 2) I immediately got to work relearning parametric 3D modeling.  I first learned it back in middle school and high school, and it turns out that, despite not doing any 3D modeling since high school, I really didn't forget a whole lot.  I was back up and making my own models in [onshape](https://www.onshape.com/en/why-onshape).  Fast forward to now, I've made quite a few of my own designs, as I've found that I don't get much joy in printing other people's designs.  I've made everything from cardboard molds, to handheld console cases, and I don't intend on stopping any time soon!
