##### Updates

---

* July 1st, 2025: added a system to replace variables in markdown content pages with meta data values.  fixed code path issue preventing content page browser tab titles from being set.  added page for pico flappy, a pico 8 flappy bird clone.
* April 28th, 2025: fixed home page update and article boxes to use up a reasonable amount of space.  added empty place-holder folders for projects that I've worked on.  wrote up an article for my adventures in puzzle making.  wrote first blog post. wrote bash script to scale images in a consistent manner, conducive to a responsive site. 
* April 14th, 2025: updated meta data blocks to be more complete. updated all markdown content files to use updated folder structure so that images show up in articles.
* April 13th, 2025: finished implementing all basic site directory.  all thats left is refinement and writing content.  updated all meta-data blocks so that all articles are viewable.  
* April 12th, 2025: got a draft of the topic directory page working with react code.  greatly improved the formatting of the topic directory page. (still needs a lot of work! such as page category filtering)  identified a large meta data formatting issue.  will need to update every markdown file on the site.
* April 11th, 2025: finally committed my huge backlog of changes to github.  hadn't pushed since end of March...  Wrote readme page for github.  continued writing react code for topic directory page template.
* April 9th, 2025: got the topic directory page to load its headline content based on input query.  shifted URI model from mixed relative / absolute to only relative.  Setup local Apache 2 web server for testing to avoid frequent file updates to Neocities.  I'm pretty sure their backend is appreciative!  Began drafting the react code to auto populate the topic directory page with content. 
* April 5th, 2025: started prototyping the content directory page.  updated all category docs to include links to their topic directory page
* April 3rd, 2025: finished adding category pages for each of the topics.  created initial prototype for the content page template.  not currently reachable by link, but can be accessed by manually writing a valid query URL.
* April 2nd, 2025: added project category hub page and started populating it with project category overviews.  created (unlinked) content page for vanity license plate project.
